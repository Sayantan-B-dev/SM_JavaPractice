ECHOES OF THE VOID

In the year 2147, humanity had stretched its fingers deep into the cosmos. The stars were no longer distant lights but territories to conquer and explore. Yet, the deeper they traveled, the darker the secrets they uncovered.

Dr. Lila Kade, an astrophysicist renowned for her work on quantum wormholes, was stationed aboard the research vessel Aetheris, orbiting the edge of the uncharted Nebula 9. The nebula was a swirling mass of cosmic dust and unknown energy signatures, something that defied all current scientific understanding.

For months, the Aetheris had been monitoring strange signals emanating from the nebula. Initially dismissed as cosmic noise, the signals gradually revealed patterns—deliberate pulses, a language almost—but from whom or what, no one knew.

Lila stared at the latest transmission on her holo-screen. The pattern wasn’t just a message; it was a warning.

Then the ship’s lights flickered. The hum of the engines shifted into an eerie silence.

“Status report!” Captain Marlow barked over the comms, his voice tense.

Lila’s fingers flew over the console. “Systems are shutting down… but there’s no external cause. It’s like the ship’s being… overridden.”

Suddenly, the Aetheris lurched violently, throwing everyone off balance. The nebula outside seemed to pulse, almost alive, enveloping the ship in an unnatural glow.

As alarms blared, Lila realized the truth—the signals were not just warnings. They were a beacon, calling something ancient and hungry from the void.

And now, whatever it was had found them.
